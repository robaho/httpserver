# httpserver

Zero-dependency implementation of the JDK `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer` [specification](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/jdk.httpserver/com/sun/net/httpserver/package-summary.html) with a few significant enhancements.

- WebSocket support using modified source code from nanohttpd.
- Server-side proxy support using [ProxyHandler](https://github.com/robaho/httpserver/blob/main/src/main/java/robaho/net/httpserver/extras/ProxyHandler.java). (Tunneling proxies are also supported using CONNECT for https.)
- HTTP/2 [RFC 9113](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html) support
- Performance enhancements such as proper HTTP pipelining, optimized String parsing, etc.

All async functionality has been removed. All synchronized blocks were removed in favor of other Java concurrency concepts.

The end result is an implementation that easily integrates with Virtual Threads available in JDK 21 - simply set a virtual thread based ExecutorService.

Improves performance by more than **10x** over the JDK implementation.

Designed for embedding with only a 200kb jar and zero dependencies.

## background

The built-in JDK httpserver implementation has no support for connection upgrades, so it is not possible to add websocket support.

Additionally, the code still has a lot of async - e.g. using SSLEngine to provide SSL support - which makes it more difficult to understand and enhance.

The thread-per-connection synchronous design simplifies the code substantially.

## testing/compliance

Nearly all tests from the JDK are included, so this version should be highly compliant and reliable.

Additional proxy and websockets tests are included.

The http2 implementation passes all specification tests in [h2spec](https://github.com/summerwind/h2spec)

## maven 
[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.robaho/httpserver.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.github.robaho/httpserver)

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.robaho</groupId>
  <artifactId>httpserver</artifactId>
  <version>use version from badge above without leading v</version>
</dependency>
```

## using

The JDK will automatically use `robaho.net.httpserver.DefaultHttpServerProvider` instead of the JDK implementation when the jar is placed on the class/module path. If there are multiple `HttpServer` providers on the classpath, the `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServerProvider` system property can be used to specify the correct one:

Eg. <code>-Dcom.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServerProvider=robaho.net.httpserver.DefaultHttpServerProvider</code>

Alternatively, you can instantiate the server directly using [this](https://github.com/robaho/httpserver/blob/main/src/main/java/robaho/net/httpserver/DefaultHttpServerProvider.java#L33).

### Example Usage
```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;

import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpExchange;
import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpHandler;
import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer;

public class Test {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    HttpServer server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(8000), 0);
    server.createContext("/", new MyHandler());
    server.setExecutor(Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()); // sets virtual thread executor
    server.start();
    }

  static class MyHandler implements HttpHandler {
    @Override
    public void handle(HttpExchange exchange) throws IOException {
      String response = "This is the response";
      byte[] bytes = response.getBytes();

      // -1 means no content, 0 means unknown content length
      var contentLength = bytes.length == 0 ? -1 : bytes.length;

      try (OutputStream os = exchange.getResponseBody()) {
        exchange.sendResponseHeaders(200, contentLength);
        os.write(bytes);
      }
    }
  }
}

```
There is a [simple file server](https://github.com/robaho/httpserver/blob/72775986b38120b30dc4bc0438d21136ff8ec192/src/test/extras/SimpleFileServer.java#L48) that can be used to for basic testing. It has download, echo, and "hello" capabilities. Use

```
gradle runSimpleFileServer
```

## Websockets

For websocket usage, see the examples in the [websocket testing folder](https://github.com/robaho/httpserver/tree/main/src/test/java/robaho/net/httpserver/websockets).

## logging

All logging is performed using the [Java System Logger](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/System.Logger.html)

## enable Http2

Http2 support is enabled via Java system properties.

Use `-Drobaho.net.httpserver.http2OverSSL=true` to enable Http2 only via SSL connections.

Use `-Drobaho.net.httpserver.http2OverNonSSL=true` to enable Http2 on Non-SSL connections (which requires prior knowledge). The Http2 upgrade mechanism was deprecated in RFC 9113 so it is not supported.

See the additional Http2 options in `ServerConfig.java`

## performance

This version performs more than **10x** faster than the JDK version when tested using the [Tech Empower Benchmarks](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/tree/master/frameworks/Java/httpserver) on an identical hardware/work setup with the same JDK 23 version.<sup>1</sup>

The frameworks were also tested using [go-wrk](https://github.com/tsliwowicz/go-wrk)<sup>2</sup>

<sup>1</sup>_The robaho version has been [submitted](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/tree/master/frameworks/Java/httpserver-robaho) to the Tech Empower benchmarks project for 3-party confirmation._<br>
<sup>2</sup>_`go-wrk` does not use http pipelining so, the large number of connections is the limiting factor._

Performance tests against the latest Jetty version were run. The `robaho httpserver` outperformed the Jetty http2 by 3x, and http1 by 5x.

The Javalin/Jetty project is available [here](https://github.com/robaho/javalin-http2-example)

## server statistics

The server tracks some basic statistics. To enable the access endpoint `/__stats`, set the system property `robaho.net.httpserver.EnableStatistics=true`.

Sample usage:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:8080/__stats
Connections: 4264
Active Connections: 2049
Requests: 2669256
Requests/sec: 73719
Handler Exceptions: 0
Socket Exceptions: 0
Mac Connections Exceeded: 0
Idle Closes: 0
Reply Errors: 0
```

The counts and rates for non "Total" statistics are reset with each pull of the statistics.

## performance notes

Http2 performance has not been fully optimized. The http2 version is about 20-30% slower than http1. I expect this to be the case with most http2 implementations due to the complexity.
http2 outperforms http1 when sending multiple simultaneous requests from the client with payloads, as most servers and clients do not implement http pipelining when payloads are involved.

TODO: sending hpack headers does not use huffman encoding or dynamic table management. see the following paper https://www.mew.org/~kazu/doc/paper/hpack-2017.pdf for optimizing the implementation further.

The most expensive operations involve converting strings to URI instances. Unfortunately, since using URI is part of the [HttpExchange API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/jdk.httpserver/com/sun/net/httpserver/HttpExchange.html#getRequestURI())  little can be done in this regard. 
It could be instantiated lazily, but almost all handlers need access to the URI components (e.g. path, query, etc.)

The standard JDK Headers implementation normalizes all headers to be first character capitalized and the rest lowercase. To ensure optimum performance, client code should use the same format to avoid the normalization cost, i.e. 

```java
Use

var value = request.getFirst("Content-length");

instead of

var value = request.getFirst("content-length"); 
var value = request.getFirst("CONTENT-LENGTH");
```
